In addition, vue-advanced-chat is compatible with all Javascript frameworks (Vue, Angular, React, etc.)

By using vue-advanced-chat alongside a chat API service like ChatKitty, developers can quickly create
chat applications with minimal boilerplate code, while also benefiting from a user-friendly and customizable UI.

This library helps reduce the time and effort required to implement chat functionalities, allowing developers
to focus on other aspects of their application. Moreover, its responsive design ensures the chat interface
adapts to different screen sizes, making it suitable for web and mobile applications alike.
